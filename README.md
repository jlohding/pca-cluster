# Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering for Pairs Trading Selection

#### Authors: Jerry Loh @jlohding, Lian Kah Seng @sunroofgod

### About
- In this project, we attempt to search for pairs of securities suitable for a mean-reversion pairs trading strategy using machine learning methods. In particular, we apply unsupervised dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques to historical daily price data for a set of 4088 ETFs. 
  - These methods include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), k-Means Clustering, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), and Hierarchical Clustering. 
- This project is part of our graded coursework in the National University of Singapore module IT1244: Artificial Intelligence: Technology and Impact.
